This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Description
Project for Stylindex company.

Make a React app to fecth a GraphQL endpoint.

It took me some time to start with Apollo client because I used to work with React, Redux and REST endpoint.

I didn't use Redux here because I thnk it's not needed. However if you need to store your login credential for example you probably need it.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

I made some testing using Jest and Enzyme (note that only Pokemon.js component it's tested because the rest of the app will be exactly the same)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
